            <h3>The Busy Bees</h3>
            <p>Wishing to bring bubbly art and sweet treats to the Senior High students at the University of San Carlos, we established The Busy Bees! The Busy Bees is  centered around spring, with vibrant pastel  colors and easter motifs to bring a light  and bright atmosphere to the school's  Intramural Days! We made sure to implement cute elements such as the animated bee to serve as the company's mascot, light yellows, pinks and oranges, as well as bold, handwritten fonts to add  playfulness to everything we create.</p>

            <h3>Youth Advocacy for the Eternal Being Magazine</h3>
            <p>Youth Advocacy for the Eternal Being, or YAEB for short, is a religion-focused advocacy that  wishes to resolve religious discrimination across the Philippines. As the editor-in-chief of the editorial  team, I was in charge of assigning tasks, designing the graphics and content, leading the photography and creative direction of the magazine, and ensuring every page leads to a single coherent  goal: to bring light to religion and spread awareness of religious discrimination to its readers. To emphasize the gravity of the issue discussed, the magazine takes on a solemn color palette dominated by blacks and blues. The imagery, drawings and  content used throughout the magazine also share this serious theme.</p>

            <h3>USC Shirt and Hoodie Contest Designs</h3>
            <p>In Grade 12, I was tasked to represent my block at the USC Merch Design Making Contest 2024 for Maximalist Shirts and Minimalist Hoodies alongside one of my blockmates. Both the hoodie and shirt take inspiration from the anti-design and Y2K apocalyptic aesthetics, with the black shirt taking a bolder approach with the vibrant neon  colors clashing against a dark background with plenty of clip art and labels, and the white hoodie taking a cleaner approach with more diluted colors in a  more peaceful white background. The black shirt won 2nd runner up in the Maximalist Shirts category.</p>

            <h3>Capy’s Calculations</h3>
            <p>In order to help achieve SDG 4, or Quality Education, we developed Capy's Calculations, an educational math game that teaches elementary and high-school students fundamental mathematics  through a never-before-seen game! We designed  our main character, Capy the Capybara, to be an  adventurous yet fun soul, hence the vibrant  warm colors and bold outlines surrounding the character. The art in the app logo and poster were  fully hand-drawn to depict the raw creativity and personal touch of our brand into our  visual designs. The game proved to be a huge success as it was presented with 5 awards, 4 of which were consecutive 1st places at University of San  Carlos' Entrep Fair 2025.</p>
